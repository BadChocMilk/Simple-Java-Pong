# Simple Java Pong

The game of pong coded entirely within Java and executable from a .jar file. This was an exercise in designing a simple game. 
Expect bugs as well as the fact that I may not come back to this.

Feel free to leave any feedback, as I am still a beginner, just please be kind about it :)
